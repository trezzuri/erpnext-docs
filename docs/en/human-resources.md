# Human Resources



The Human Resources (HR) module covers the processes related to the HR department of a company. It maintains a complete employee database including contact information,
salary details, attendance, performance evaluation, leaves, and appraisal records.


The most important feature here is processing the payroll by using Payroll Entry to generate Salary Slips. Most countries have complex tax rules stating which expenses the company can make on behalf of its Employees.


There are a set of rules for the company to deduct taxes and social security
from employee payroll. ERPNext accommodates all types of taxes and
their calculation.
