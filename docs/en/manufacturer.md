# Manufacturer



**A manufacturer created or produces an Item.**


A Manufacturer may not be the same person/company that sells the Item under a specific [Brand](/docs/en/selling/brand). For example, Unico Plastics can be the Manufacturer of plastic brushes but it may be sold under a Brand, say, Super Brushes.


In ERPNext, a Manufacturer can be used to identify Items using a specific part number.
