# Add columns in Standard Report and Export



In **Standard Reports** of **ERPNext** such as *SOA, Accounts Receivable/Payable etc*, we provide an option to **Add/Remove Columns** from the documents and display it in the Report, these columns are only meant for reference at that particular moment of time.

If the User needs to *Export* along with the changes made by him in the Report, the User needs to Save the Report and then *Export* it.
