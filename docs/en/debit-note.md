# Debit Note



**A Debit Note is a document sent by a buyer to the Supplier notifying that a debit has been recorded against the goods returned to the Supplier.**


A Debit Note is issued for the value of the goods returned. In some cases, sellers are seen sending Debit Notes which should be treated as like another invoice.


A Debit is for your record of the debit against the Items your return.


## 1. How to create Debit Note


The user can make a Debit Note against the Purchase Invoice or they can directly make Debit Note from the Purchase Invoice without reference.

Refer the [Purchase Invoice](/docs/en/accounts/purchase-invoice) page for any other details.


### 1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice


In case **no payment** was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Debit Note is useful for updating the ledger.
