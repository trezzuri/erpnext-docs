# Setting Company Sales Goal



**Defining and achieving sales goals/targets can help your company reach new goals and increase revenue.**


1. Monthly sales targets can be set for a Company via the Company master under the Sales Settings section. By default, the Company master dashboard displays month-wise past sales stats.
