# Sharing



**You can share documents with other users via sharing in ERPNext.**


In addition to user and role permissions, you can also share a document with another user if you have sharing rights for that document. Note that, a shared document will be visible to the other user even if the document is restricted via [User Permissions](/docs/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/user-permissions).


To share a document, open the document, click on the "+" icon under sharing and select the user with whom you want to share:


![](/files/share.png)


In the popup window, you can either select all users or one particular user.


Read, write, submit, and share access can be granted to the user for this document.
