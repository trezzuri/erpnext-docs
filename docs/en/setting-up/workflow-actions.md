**Workflow Actions is a single place to manage all the pending actions you can take on Workflows.**


Workflow Actions will send email notifications only if the 'Send Email Alert' checkbox is ticked in the Workflow that you've created.


To access Workflow Actions, go to:



> 
> Home > Settings > Workflow Actions
> 
> 
> 


If a User is eligible to take action on some workflows, emails will be sent to the user with the relevant document as attachment. From there the user can `Approve` or `Reject` the Workflow.

Also the users will see entries in their Workflow Action list:

**Note:**


* You can set email template for Workflow Actions on each state. The template might consist of a message for users to proceed with the next Workflow Actions.
* Workflow Actions will not be created for a transition to optional states.
