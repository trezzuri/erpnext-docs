# Downloading Backups



In the ERPNext, you can manually download database backup. To get the latest database backup, go to:


> Home > Settings > Download Backups


Backup available for the download is updated in every eight hours. Click on the link to download the backup at a given time.

By default three latest backups will be available for the download. To change this, click on "Set Number of Backups". This will take you to System Settings where you can set Number of Backups available for download at a time.
