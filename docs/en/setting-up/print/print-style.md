**In Print Style you can define custom CSS styles applied to Print Formats.**

The standard print Styles in ERPNext are: Monochrome, Modern, and Classic.
To create a new **Print Style** go to:

## 1. How to create a new Print Style


1. Go to the Print Style list, click on New.
2. Enter a name for the Print Style.
3. Enter the CSS that'll define how the style will look like.

The styles you create here apply to both standard and custom print formats. To find out the various CSS classes available, you can make a standard print format, open in a new page and see the source.


A default Print Style, can be set from [Print Settings](/docs/en/setting-up/print/print-settings).


All Print Format styles are based on Bootstrap (Version 3) CSS Framework.
