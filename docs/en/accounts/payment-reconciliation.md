# Payment Reconciliation



**Payment Reconciliation is used to link payments with invoices.**

In complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices. For example, suppose a party is a customer, you send invoices to a customer and the customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked to your invoices.

In such cases, you can match Payments with Invoices using Payment Reconciliation.

To access Payment Reconciliation, go to:


> Home > Accounting > Accounts Receivable > Payment Reconciliation
> 
>

## 2. What happens on Payment Reconciliation

If the invoices are reconciled against:Â 

1. **Payment Entry** - A journal entry is not auto-created when reconciliation happens against a payment entry. This is because payment entries are associated with linked transactions.
2. **Credit/Debit Note** - A journal entry is auto-created to allocate a credit/debit note to an invoice that is being reconciled. This automatic creation of a journal entry is necessary since credit/debit notes do not have linked transactions. The journal entry resulting from the reconciliation indicates the adjustment of a particular credit/debit note with a specific invoice.
