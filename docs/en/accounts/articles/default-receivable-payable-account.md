# Default Receivable / Payable Account



  
**Question:**  
 How to link a Receivable or Payable Account with the Party (Customer / Supplier)?  
**Answer:**  
In ERPNext, the accounts for tracking Receivable (Debtors) and Payables (Creditors) are auto-created in the Chart of Accounts master. These accounts are also set as default Receivable and Payable Accounts in the Company masters. If you wish to proceed with these default Accounts, then you need not specify it for each Party.  
However, if you have created multiple Receivable and Payable Accounts in the Chart of Accounts, you can associate specific account with the specific party from Customer or Supplier master. In these master, check "Accounting Section."
