Click on the Menu and select 'Close the POS'. Select the period, your POS Profile and your user to retrieve all sales registered.


On creating a POS Closing Voucher, all the POS invoices fetched for the selected period will be consolidated into one final Sales Invoice. The status of all the POS invoices will change from 'Paid' to 'Consolidated' once they are successfully consolidated into a sales invoice on closing.

If there are more than 10 invoices while closing a POS, consolidation of the invoices will take place in a background job and would be subitted after the background job gets completed. The Accounting Ledgers would be affected only after the Closing Voucher is submitted successfully and the consolidated sales invoices are created.
