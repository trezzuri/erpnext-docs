# Product Listing



ERPNext provides a product listing page where your customers can discover your
products. It is enabled by default if you have published **Website Items** on your system.


You can go to the product listing visiting the **/all-products** route. For example,
`https://apple.erpnext.com/all-products`.

Here there are two views available that can be toggled:


### Product List View


The List View can hold additional data in it such as a short description which can be mentioned in the Website Item's **Short Website Description** field.

### Filters


This page also shows filters alongside the products. There are three types of filters visible here: **Field Filters**, **Attribute Filters** and **Discount Filters**.


* **Field Filters** and **Attribute Filters** can be configured in the [Filters and Categories](/docs/en/e_commerce/e_commerce_settings#filters-and-categories) section of **E Commerce Settings**.
* **Discount Filters** are automatically generated based on the discounts applied on the products. They do not require any configuration.
