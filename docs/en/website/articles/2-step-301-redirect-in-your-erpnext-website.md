# 2 Step 301 Redirect in your ERPNext Website



  
**What is 301 Redirect?**  
A **301 Redirect** is used to make sure that search engines and users are sent to the correct page. A 301 status code is used when any page has been permanently moved to another location. Users will now see the new URL as it has replaced the old page.
