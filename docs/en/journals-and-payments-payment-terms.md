# Payment Terms



**A Payment Term helps to set a schedule according to which payments will be made.**


A Payment Term defines a specific payment slab. For example, 50% payment on shipping and 50% on delivery of the item. You can save your business's payment terms on ERPNext and include them in all documents in the sales/purchase cycle. ERPNext will make all the General Ledger entries accordingly.


In ERPNext, the Payment Terms form only defines portion percentages. The actual payment schedule can easily be applied using the Payment Terms Template.


You can use Payment Terms in the following documents:


* Sales Invoice
* Purchase Invoice
* Sales Order
* Purchase Order
* Quotation


To access Payment Term go to:
> Home > Accounting > Accounting Masters > Payment Term

## 1. How to create a Payment Term


1. Go to the Payment Term list and click on New.
2. Enter a name for the Payment Term (eg: 50% post-shipment).
3. Enter the Invoice portion. If you enter 50, the portion will be 50 percent of the Invoice amount.
4. Select a Due Date type.
5. Under Credit Days enter the number of days after which the remaining amount has to be paid.
6. Save.


The fields are explained as follows:


* **Payment Term Name:** The name for this Payment Term.

	+ **Day(s) after invoice date**: Due date should be calculated in days concerning the posting date of the invoice. For example, if 7 is entered on date 20th, the due date will be 27.
	+ **Day(s) after the end of the invoice month**: Due date should be calculated in days concerning the last day of the month in which the invoice was created. For example, if 7 is entered in the current month and the last day of the month is 30th, the due date will be the 7th of the next month.
	+ **Month(s) after the end of the invoice month**: Due date should be calculated in months concerning the last day of the month in which the invoice was created. For example, if 3 is entered on the 20th of January, the due date will be on 20th March.

You can now link the Payment Terms with an Invoice and on creating the payment against such invoice, the discount will be applied automatically.
