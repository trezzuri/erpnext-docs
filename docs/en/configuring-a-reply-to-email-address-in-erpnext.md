Prerequisites:


You must have an email address record created in the ‘Email Account’ DocType for the desired email address, for example, ‘[abc@test.com](mailto:abc@test.com)'.


Steps:


In the record for email address ‘[abc@test.com](mailto:abc@test.com)' created in the 'Email Account' DocType, enable the 'Enable Incoming' checkbox and then the 'Default Incoming' checkbox. Enabling the 'Default Incoming' checkbox will then set this email as the email in 'Reply-To' (sample screenshot below).
