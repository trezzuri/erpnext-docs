# Sharing



**'Sharing' allows users to share a particular document with other users in ERPNext.**

In addition to user and role permissions, you can also share a document with another user if you have sharing rights for that document. Note that, a shared document will be visible to the other user even if the document is restricted via [User Permissions](/docs/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/user-permissions).

## **How to share a document?**

1. Open the document that you want to share and click on the '+'icon under 'Shared With'.
2. Select the user with whom you need to share the document.
3. If the document is to be shared with all users then just select 'Everyone'.
4. Tick appropriate checkboxes to provide relevant rights to the user with whom the document is getting shared.
5. Click on the Add button to get the user added.
6. You can share the same document with multiple users by adding them one by one.
