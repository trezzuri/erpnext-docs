# Stock Transfer with GST



In certain situations, there are statutory requirements where taxes are to be applied on each transfer of Material. It is easier to manage it in a transaction like a Sales Invoice, than in the Stock Entry. Please follow the following steps to transfer material from one branch to another using Sales and Purchase Invoice
