# Reviews and Ratings



Feedback is important to gauge the public sentiment of a product being sold. You can measure your product's performance by adding **Reviews and Ratings** to the Website Item's page. To enable this go to:



> 
> E Commerce Settings > Add-ons > Enable Reviews and Ratings
> 
> 
> 


Once this is done, there will be a provision in every Website Item's page to leave a review on the product.


#### Who can leave reviews?


Users that are also **Customers** in the system will be able to see the **Write a Review** button. These users must also have the **Customer Role** to be permitted to add reviews.


The average reviews are automatically calculated and a summary is displayed.
