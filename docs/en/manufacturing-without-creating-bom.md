# Manufacturing without creating BOM



**It is recommended to use BOM for Manufacturing for consistency and to avoid repetitive work.**   
However, if you wish to perform it manually, the workaround is to create Stock Entries:1) Create a **Stock Entry** with **Purpose** as **Material Transfer to Manufacture.**![](/files/EsxLtl4.png)2) Create a **Stock Entry** with **Purpose** as **Manufacture, the Item which is being Manufactured will have a Target Warehouse and other Items(Raw Materials) will have a Source Warehouse.**
