## 3. Features


### 3.1 Creating Job Applicant and auto-syncing status from Job Applicant


When you submit an employee referral document the initial status will be "Pending". After submitting the document, the "Create Job Applicant" button will appear at the top right corner.


Clicking this button will create a new **Job Applicant*\* with the status "Open". The status of the \**Employee Referral** document will change to "In Process"

When someone changes the status of the **Job Applicant*\* to "Hold" or "Replied", the status of the \**Employee Referral*\* will remain "In Process". If the status of the \**Job Applicant*\* changes to "Accepted" or "Rejected", the status of the \**Employee Referral** document will also change to "Accepted" or "Rejected" respectively.


### 3.2 Managing referral bonus


Many companies provide bonuses to their employees for such referrals. Frappe HR allows you to track the payment of the bonus to the employee for their referral.


For the Referral bonus, you need to check the "Is applicable for referral bonus" checkbox before submitting the document. After submitting the document, the "Create Additional Salary" button will appear at the top right corner, if the status is "Accepted".
