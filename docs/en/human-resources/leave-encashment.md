> **Note:** As you select Employee and Leave Type, Leave Balance and Encashable Days (which is total leave balance minus the threshold days set in Leave Type) will be shown along with the Encashment Amount based on the Leave Encashment per day as configured in the Employee's assigned Salary Structure.


On submitting a Leave Encashment for an Employee, Frappe HR automatically creates an [Additional Salary](/docs/en/human-resources/additional-salary) which will get added to the Salary Slip of the Employee when processing the payroll.
