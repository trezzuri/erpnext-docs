# Employee Onboarding



**In the process of hiring an Employee, there are set of standard activities which need to be executed. This feature helps you to maintain the masters of these activities, and create a set of tasks at the time of each Employee hiring.**


Employee Onboarding is created for a Job Application, who is approved for the hiring.


**Use Case:** Let's assume that following are the activities which need to be performed as soon as a job applicant is approved to be hired.


* Perform a legal and professional background check
* Create an Employee master
* Create an Email Account
* Create an identity card
* Allocate leaves


In Frappe HR, these standard activities can be tracked in the Employee Onboarding Template. To access Employee Onboarding, go to:


> Human Resources > Employee Lifecycle > Employee Onboarding
