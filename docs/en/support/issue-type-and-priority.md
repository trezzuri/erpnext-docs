**Issue Type is useful for tagging and classifying Issues.**


Classifying Issues helps in assigning the concerned team members to specific Issues. Examples of Issue Types can be: 'Functional', 'Technical', 'Hardware', etc. So engineers can be assigned to technical or hardware issues and consultants would be assigned to address functional issues.
