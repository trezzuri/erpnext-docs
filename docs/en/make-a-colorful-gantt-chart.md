# Make A Colorful Gantt Chart



ERPNext allows users to add colours to certain documents for better visual cues and representation. A good example of this would be the [Event Calendar](/docs/en/using-erpnext/calendar), where, for each event you can add a colour.


We will be doing so by customizing [Tasks](/docs/en/projects/tasks) under Projects module.


## Steps To Add Colours To The Gantt Chart


1. Go to [Customize Form](/docs/en/customize-erpnext/customize-form) in the system and select *Task* in *Enter Form Type* option. Alternatively, you can reach this screen by going to **Menu > Customize** from the Task list or form.

2. Add a new field in the doctype of fieldtype color.
3. Check *In List View* option.

4. Save the form, go back to the Task list, and reload.
5. When opening an existing or new Task, you should see a color field. Pick a color for the Task.
