# Quality Feedback



**Quality Feedback is the information that a Customer expresses about the satisfaction or dissatisfaction about the products or services you offer.**


Quality Feedback has different fields to rate different parameters. The Customer/User can easily give their feedback by selecting their template to rate on different parameters and also provide qualitative feedback on these parameters.


You can also fetch the parameters using a [Quality Feedback Template](/docs/en/quality-management/quality-feedback-template). The templates store preset information for you to select in the Quality Feedback.


If the Feedback is not as per expectations, a Quality Action may be initialized on the basis of the seriousness of the Feedback.
