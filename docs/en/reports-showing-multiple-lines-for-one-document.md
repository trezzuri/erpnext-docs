# Report Showing Multiple Lines for One Document



**Question:**

  


I have made a report on Purchase Invoice. Why following Invoice is being shown twice in the report?

**Answer:**

  


It must be because in the Pick Columns, you have selected a field from Child Table (like Item or taxes table). Since that table has two rows, it's been shown twice in the report. Just scroll to far-right to confirm.
