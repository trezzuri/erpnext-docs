# Serialised inventory tracking



Use case:

  


In a manufacturing scenario, the item is manufactured and the serial numbers are generated once the Stock entry is submitted.

But if there is a need for creating the list of serial numbers without auto creation (dynamically as per requirement). How can the serial numbers be generated?

  


Go to Item list --> Create new item --> Check **Has Serial Number**

Go to **Serial number** doctype --> Create serial numbers

While manufacturing, Work order --> Finish --> Stock entry --> Select serial numbers as per the manufacturing quantity.

  


This allows you to select Serial numbers dynamically at the time of manufacturing.
