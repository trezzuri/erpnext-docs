But when I do so using the [print format builder](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/print/print-format-builder), I end up losing my Item Code and Name as well. How to fix this?

**Answer:**


This is because you have **Compact Item Print** option enabled in the Print Settings.

You can disable this option and then uncheck the Description in the print format builder. This should solve the issue for you.
