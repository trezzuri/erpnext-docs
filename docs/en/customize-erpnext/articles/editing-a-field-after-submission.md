# Edit a Field after Submission



In ERPNext, once a document is submitted, you can only edit it through Cancel > Amend. However, you can still make certain fields (custom fields) editable after submission using the **Allow on Submit** feature. For example, we have created a custom field called "Supplier ID" in Supplier Quotation. To allow editing of this field after submission, follow the following steps:  
1) Go to Settings > Customize Form and select the Form Type (Supplier Quotation in this case).  
2) Expand the field row and check the "Allow on Submit" checkbox.

3) Click on Update.  
This setting will allow you to edit this field even after submitting the document without amending it.  
**Note:** The Allow on Submit feature works only for non-standard fields (custom fields).
