# Lower Deduction Certificate



According to the tax withholding category, a person responsible for making payments is required to deduct tax at source at prescribed rates. Instead of receiving tax on your income from you at a later date, the government wants the payers to deduct tax beforehand and deposit it with the government. However this scheme of deducting tax at source may cause issues to a few taxpayers who may not have taxable income for that fiscal year.


Therefore, for such taxpayers, the government provides an option to obtain a certificate confirming to either a lower rate or NIL rate of TDS compared to the rate specified in the tax withholding category.

2. Let's create an invoice for 20,000. Saving the invoice automatically calculates tax and appends it in the Purchase Taxes and Charges table. Although the tax category assigned to the supplier has a tax rate of 5%, the prevailing tax rate is 1% which is mentioned in the Lower Deduction Certificate.
