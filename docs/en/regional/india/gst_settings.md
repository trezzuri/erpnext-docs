### Accounts


GST Accounts form a very important part of GST Settings. Many validations and calculations are based on these settings.


You should have 3 rows for each company in GST Accounts one for each Input, Output and Reverse Charge Accounts.


Specify individual CGST / SGST / IGST / Cess Accounts as created and applicable to you.


Correct usage of accounts and taxes is validated based on these settings. Also important calculations like taxable value or ITC Availability are calculated based on these settings.



> 
> It is important to note that multiple GST accounts are not recommended and allowed for simplicity. You can maintain only one GST Account for multiple tax rates or even for Multi-GSTIN setup for your company. Further Analysis and breakup is easy to establish from the transactions without the need of maintaining multiple accounts, and hence this simplicity.
