# Global Defaults



**Global Defaults helps you pre-set few fields for system wide use.**

Instead of manually inserting the values for certain fields, you might want to have them automatically fetched while creating documents. To do so, you can set the values in 'Global Defaults' so that the system can fetch them automatically and set as default while creating any transactions.

The values set here will impact all users and the default values for various fields will be set for them.

To access Global Defaults,
