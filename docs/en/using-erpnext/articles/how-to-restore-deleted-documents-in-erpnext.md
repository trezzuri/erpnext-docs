# Restore Deleted Documents



**Use Case:** Need to restore/ retrieve the documents that were deleted.  
**Steps:**  
1) Go to Settings > Deleted Documents (or search for "Deleted Document list" in the search bar).  
2) Search for the deleted document. You can also filter out the document based on the Deleted DocType. For example we need to restore the Purchase Order, PUR-ORD-2019-00019. To do so, search for the same in the deleted document list and open it.
