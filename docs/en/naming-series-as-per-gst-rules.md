# Naming Series as Per GST Rules



Rule 46 (b) of the CGST **Rules** 2017 specifies that the tax **invoice** issued by a registered person should have a consecutive serial **number**, not exceeding sixteen characters, in one or multiple series, containing alphabets or numerals or special characters – hyphen or dash and slash symbolized as “-” and “/” respectively

  


This validation will come into effect in ERPNext from the new fiscal year i.e FY 2021-22. If you encounter an error similar to one shown in the screenshot below, follow the below steps to resolve the issue and add a new naming series for Sales and Purchase Invoices
