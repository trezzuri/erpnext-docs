# Brandwise Items and Profitability Report



**Question:** If we track items based on Brand (available above Item Description), can we:  
* Search Items in transactions based on Brand?
* Get Sales and Purchase Report based on Brand?
* Get Brand-wise Profitability?

  
**Answer:**  
While creating transactions, for searching items, we can also type Brand and have search result based on Brand. To ensure if works, brand should be in the Search Field of Item master.

Brand will be fetched in selection of Item Code in all the core sales and purchase transactions. Later, you should be able to get Brandwise Sales and purchase report from Report Builder for each sales and purchase transaction.   
Also, you can avail gross profit based on Brand.
