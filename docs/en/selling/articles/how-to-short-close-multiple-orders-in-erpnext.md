# Short Close Multiple Orders



Short closingÂ of a Sales Order is equivalent to the deletion of the Sales Order. No further transactions are allowed against the Sales Order if it is short closed (unless it is re-opened). 

  


In ERPNext, you can close a Sales Order by clicking on the "Close" option under Status as shown in the below screenshot.

However, sometimes, you might want to close multiple Sales Orders in one go. To do so, follow the below steps:

  


1) Go to Sales Order List

  


2) Select the Sales Orders which you want to short close

  


3) Go to Menu and click on "Close"

This will bulk close all the selected Sales Orders.

  


If you wish to Re-open the closed Sales Orders, select them and go to Menu > Re-open.

  


**Note:** The same steps can be followed to Close/Re-open multiple Purchase Orders.
