# Collaborating Around Forms



**In ERPNExt, every form comes with certain tools embedded in the system which allows you to collaborate with other users within your account to have quick and transparent operations.**


Following are the tools in each document using which you can collaborate with other Users in your ERPNext account.


### Assigned to


If a Document requires some action from a particular user, you can assign that document to that User. On assignment, the user shall be intimated of the same via an email. [Click here](/docs/en/using-erpnext/assignment) to learn more about this feature.


E.g., an incoming [Lead](/docs/en/CRM/lead) can e assigned to a particular user to ensure that the same is being pursued by them.
